- 👋 Hi, I’m @irw04
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, frontend development, and AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack developing and ASP.net specifically while doing front-end design regularly to keep growth in that. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything front-end, can't be trusted with backend stuff right now. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email is ivanr.wahl@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: there are no fun facts about me.
